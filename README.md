# ww_core_10_SD_card

This are
- the number pictures for the Old Time Clock demo
- the eye pictures for the eye demo
- some sound bits for the Sound demo

Copy this files in the root directory of an SD card and push it into your Wood-Walker. Maybe you have to reset the Wood-walker after you have put in the SD card.

Please remember:
- the wwAudio.h only playes wav files on the AtmelSAM3x8
- the SD.h recognizes 8.3 file names only (hello1234.wav)
